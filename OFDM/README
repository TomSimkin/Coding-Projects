To run the code, install Python and an IDE such as Pycharm, VS Code, etc.
I personally use Pycharm, here are the links for the software:
Python - https://www.python.org/downloads/ (make sure to download the latest version)
Pycharm - https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/other.html (if you do not have a license, download the community version).

In my code you will see an all around example of a simple OFDM system.
