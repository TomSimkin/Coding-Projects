Connect Four - two player strategy game on a 4x4 grid. Drop colored discs into columns, aiming to form four in a row 
vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Fully implemented using x86 assembly on DOSBOX emulator.

Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) - Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) is used to increase the number of
interrupt lines a controller can handle. The design transfers the highest priority, non masked, interrupt to the CPU on a data 
bus and also signals the CPU that there is an interrupt request. Written in VHDL and simulated on ModelSIM.

FEC Hamming -  RTL model of 8 bit to 12 bit synchronous parallel encoder and 12 bit to 8 bit synchronous parallel decoder on code Hamming.

OFDM (Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) - multicarrier system that is applied in a wide range of wireless transmission systems.
Coded in Python, I demonstrate an example of a complete OFDM system.
